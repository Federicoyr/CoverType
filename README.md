Abstract: In this paper, we address the optimization of a
neural network to perform accurate classification on a dataset. In
Section 1, the hyperparameter tuning of the network is explored
and its performance is evaluated using classification metrics.
Model selection decisions are justified by analyzing learning
curves and the decision boundaries found are visualized. In Point
2, the task of classification of mystery data provided in two sets:
public_dataset and quiz is described. The creation of a neural
network model to predict the variable 'label' is detailed.
